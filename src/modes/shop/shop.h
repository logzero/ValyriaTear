*** This class shows summary information about the currently selected object. It displays

*** and shows only a limited amount of information. This is the default view mode that the
*** player sees and this information is visible in tandem with the graphics displayed by the
*** BuyListView class. The second view mode is entered if the player requests to see all the
*** details about the selected object. In this view mode, the BuyListView class' graphics are
*** hidden and this class displays the complete set of information about the selected object
*** using both the middle and lower menu windows. The type of information which is displayed is
*** different depending upon what type of object is selected. The primary purpose of this class
*** is to serve as a helper to the BuyInterface class and to keep the code organized.
***
*** \todo Currently this class treats the display of spirits the same as it does for items
*** and key items. This should be changed once spirit properties have a more clear definition
*** in the game design.
***
*** \todo Status icons are not currently displayed as there are no status effects implemented
*** in the game yet. Once status effects are functional and graphics are ready to represent
*** them, this code should be updated.
***
*** \todo The character sprites are not yet animated in the display. This should be changed
*** once the appropriate set of sprite frames are available for this menu.
