*** \brief Manages the shop when it is in sell mode and enables the player to sell their inventory
***
*** This interface displays the list of objects that are available for the player to sell.
*** It organizes these objects based on their object type/category (item, weapon, etc.) and
*** allows the player to switch between views of these different categories. This interface
*** also displays information about the currently selected object such as its description,
*** statistical ratings, usable characters, etc.
***
*** \note The player is never allowed to sell key items, even if the shop has key
*** items available for purchase. A shop that only deals in key items means that
*** no categories would be available on the sell interface. As the code stands now, this
*** particular case would most certainly cause shop mode to crash upon entering the sell
*** interface.
