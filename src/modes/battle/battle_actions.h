*** \brief Representation of a single action to be executed in battle
***
*** This is an abstract base class for all action classes to inherit from. Actions are what
*** actors perform in battle whenever they move to attack an opponent, protect a comrade, use
*** an item, etc. There is no distinguishment between characters and enemies as far as the action
*** classes are concerned. All actions are implemented via Lua script functions that perform the
*** necessary synchronization of visual and audio media presented to the user as well as modifying
*** any change to the stats of the actor or target. Actions (and by proxy the actors executing them)
*** may be either processed individually one at a time, or multiple skills may be executed
*** simulatenously.
***
*** Each action used determines the amount of time that the actor using the action
*** must wait in the warm up and cool down states. The warm up state is when the
*** actor has chosen to use the action but has not yet used it. The cool down state
*** occurs immediately after the actor finishes the action an
