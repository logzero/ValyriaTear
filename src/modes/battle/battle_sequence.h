*** \brief   Header file for battle sequence manager.
***
*** Battle sequences are the brief scenes that the player sees when the battle
*** first begins, transitions to the finish menu, or exits. Other types of
*** sequences may also be executed. During a sequence, the player has no control
*** over the events unfolding on the screen.

*** \brief Controls audio and visual elements to produce various sequences
***
*** Certain sequences such as when a battle first begins require a lot of operations that are
*** not required for the remainder of the time that a battle is active. The purpose of this class
*** is to enable those custom operations and prevent the BattleMode class from being inundated
*** with members and methods that are rarely used. This class supports multiple different sequences
*** and thus some members and methods may only pertain to one sequence or another, Other members and methods
*** may be shared among sequences.
***
*** Currently this class supports the following sequences:
***   - Battle initialization
***   - TODO: Transition to finish screen
***   - Battle exit
***
*** \note BattleMode declares this class as a friend, and hence this class has access to all private data and methods of
*** the BattleMode class.
